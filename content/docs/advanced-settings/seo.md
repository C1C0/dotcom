**SEO** means Search Engine Optimization and is the process used to optimize a website's technical configuration, content relevance and link popularity so its pages can become easily findable, more relevant and popular towards user search queries, and as a consequence, search engines rank them better.

Memos provides SEO optimization for all public memos. All you need to do is set up an instance URL in the **System Settings** page. Then Memos will generate `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` files for your instance automatically. You can access these files by visiting `https://<your-instance-url>/sitemap.xml` and `https://<your-instance-url>/robots.txt`.
