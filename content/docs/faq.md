## How to change datetime to a memo

## How to upload videos in memos

You can upload small videos, with up to 32 MB.

Beside that, videos must use a container and codecs compatible with HTML5, as memos won't convert them like YouTube do when you upload something.
Prefer mp4/webm containers with H264/H265 for video, and AAC/Opus for audio, for maximum browser compatibility. [https://www.chromium.org/audio-video/](https://www.chromium.org/audio-video/)

YouTube and other video services embedding is not supported. For now, the best you can do in this case is upload a thumbnail picture and link directly to the external video.
